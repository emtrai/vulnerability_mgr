......**UNDER DEVELOPMENT**......

Don't disappoint if source code is messy.
I dont' have much time to mature it.

**Use this with your risk.**


## Introduction

Manage cyber security vulnerabilities, hereafter vulnerabilities, include CVE, and/or any detected vulnerabilities which have not been assigned CVE number yet.
It shall not replace NIST, MITRE, etc., but rely on them.

Purpose is to manage status detected/disclosed vulnerabilities in projects.

It's possible to use MS Excel for this management.
MS Excel is powerful tool from Microsoft, but it becomes heavily when the number of vulnerabilities is increased ... dramatically.

Opening big excel file, mean you're challenging your PC. Good luck to him.
